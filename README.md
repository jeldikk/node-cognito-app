# Express Node AWS-Cognito App

A POC express node app to demonstrate different operations of authentiation and authorization with aws cognito. 

Majorly a backend app which works with postman to signup a user, explore different tokens

Replace your AWS_COGNITO_* related values with yours and try it out.

This project was heavily inspired from the documentation of amazon-cognito-identity-js documentation and tried out different operations for demonstration.
